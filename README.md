### How it Works
- Kitchen: The automation system is reviewed based on the temperature and humidity of the kitchen room, when the kitchen temperature reaches 31 degrees Celsius, the relay indicates that the fan motor will turn on to reduce the room temperature and provide temperature and humidity notifications on the telegram. In addition, the kitchen can also monitor the electric kettle with manual control using a smartphone (via MQTT dash software).
- Terrace: The automation system is reviewed based on the light intensity outside the room, where when the LDR sensor input has a light intensity value of less than 300, the terrace lights will turn off. Meanwhile, the terrace light will turn on when the percentage is more than 300. In addition, the light intensity status can also be displayed on Telegram.
